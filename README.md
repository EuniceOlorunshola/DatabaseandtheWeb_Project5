# Project6

# Description about this project 

I did this project for my database and the web class as a graduate student and used neo4j for the graph database.

# Instructions

Consider the Neo4J database loaded in loadParts.py. Run this program to create the graph database. Then, write a program to compute cost of parts as well as basic subparts of parts. A sample run is given below:


(c) cost of part
(s) sub-parts
(q) quit

What do you want to see: c
Enter part name: engine
Cost of engine is 744.0

(c) cost of part
(s) sub-parts
(q) quit

What do you want to see: c
Enter part name: cylinder
Cost of cylinder is 29.0

(c) cost of part
(s) sub-parts
(q) quit

What do you want to see: s
Enter part name: engine
Subparts of pname: 

bolt 192
screw 136
gasket 16
sparkplug 4


(c) cost of part
(s) sub-parts
(q) quit

What do you want to see: s
Enter part name: cylinder
Subparts of pname: 

bolt 4
screw 6
gasket 3


(c) cost of part
(s) sub-parts
(q) quit

What do you want to see: q
